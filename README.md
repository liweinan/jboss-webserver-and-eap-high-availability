# JBoss Web Server and EAP High Availability

JBoss Web Server is a product produced by Red Hat[^1]. The product is comprised of fully open-source projects coming from Apache and JBoss communities to provide a `lightweight` solution on establishing web server clusters, such as: `Apache Tomcat`, `HTTPD`, `mod_cluster`, `openssl`, etc.

JBoss EAP is the flag product come from JBoss community, it's a middleware fully comprised of opensource projects, and it works well with the open-sourced clustering component 

I'd like to share my thoughts on these two products while I'm working on it. I have written a book in before to introduce part of the area[^2]. And in future I'd like to keep sharing related topics here.
