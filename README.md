# Thoughts on JBoss Web Server


JBoss Web Server is a product produced by Red Hat: 

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/web-server

The product is comprised of fully open-source projects coming from Apache and JBoss communities to provide a _lightweight_ solution on establishing web server clusters, such as: Apache Tomcat, HTTPD, mod\_cluster, openssl, etc.

And I'd like to share my thoughts on this product while I'm working on it. For example, I'll introduce the usages of Tomcat, HTTPD, openssl and mod\_clusters and how they interactive with each other.

I have written a book in before to introduce part of the area:

And in future I'd like to keep sharing clustering and SSL related topics here.
